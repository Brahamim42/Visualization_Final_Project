## 📖 Overview
The **Global Crisis Dashboard** is an interactive analytical tool designed to explore how major global shocks—**Wars, Political Shifts, and Pandemics**—reshape the trajectory of nations. 

By integrating data on **Life Expectancy**, **GDP per Capita**, and **Happiness Scores**, this dashboard helps users visualize the "Before & After" of historical turning points for the world's top 15 strategic nations and conflict-specific zones.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. 🏛️ Political Events
*Focus: Resilience & Policy Impact*
* **The "Winners & Losers" Dumbbell Chart**: clear visualization of how countries improved or declined after major political shifts (e.g., *The Abraham Accords*, *Trump's Election*).
* **Global Impact Map**: A choropleth map showing the net change in Happiness, GDP, or Life Expectancy across the globe.

### 2. ⚔️ Wars & Conflict
*Focus: The Cost of Destruction*
* **Crisis Trajectory**: A normalized index chart (Baseline = 100) tracking the relative impact of war on a specific country's economy and social health.
* **Head-to-Head**: A direct comparison of two conflicting nations (e.g., *USA vs. China*, *Armenia vs. Azerbaijan*) across three key metrics simultaneously.

### 3. 🦠 Epidemics
*Focus: The "Health vs. Wealth" Dilemma*
* **Trade-off Scatter Plot**: A unique quadrant analysis categorizing countries into "Resilient" (Health+ Wealth+) or "Crisis" (Health- Wealth-) zones during events like COVID-19 or the Zika Virus.
* **Health Impact Map**: Visualizing the global toll on life expectancy.

## 📊 Data & Metrics
The dashboard aggregates data from three primary CSV sources:
* **💰 Economy:** Real GDP per Capita (`macro.csv`)
* **😊 Social:** Happiness Scores (0-10) (`happiness.csv`)
* **❤️ Health:** Life Expectancy in years (`life.csv`)

> **Note:** The analysis highlights **15 Strategic Nations** (including USA, China, Israel, Russia, India, etc.) but loads global data for map visualizations.
